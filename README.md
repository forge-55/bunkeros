## Keybindings

This configuration uses minimal, intuitive keybindings that are consistent across major tiling window managers. The philosophy is to provide only the essential bindings, leaving room for users to customize with their favorite applications and scripts.

### Design Philosophy

- **Minimal by default** - Only essential keybindings included
- **Mnemonic system** - Keys match their function (a=apps, b=browser, e=editor, f=files, m=menu, t=terminal)
- **Alternative bindings** - Common actions have alternatives for users from different WMs (Super+Space, Super+Enter)
- **No Shift modifiers** - Essential actions use single keys for speed
- **User-configurable** - Default apps set via variables at top of config
- **Customization-friendly** - Clear space for users to add personal bindings

### Essential Keybindings

**Basic Actions:**
- `Super+a` or `Super+Space` - Application launcher (Wofi)
- `Super+b` - Open default web browser
- `Super+e` - Text editor
- `Super+Escape` - Lock screen
- `Super+f` - File manager

### Keybinding Manager

BunkerOS includes an **interactive keybinding manager** that makes discovering and customizing keybindings easy, even for users new to tiling window managers.

**Access**: `Super+m` → **Keybindings**

**Features**:
- **View All Keybindings** - Browse every keybinding in a searchable list
- **Search Keybindings** - Find specific keybindings by key combo or action
- **Add New Keybindings** - Create custom keybindings via GUI (no config editing needed)
- **Edit Keybindings** - Select a keybinding to open the config at that exact line
- **Keybinding Cheatsheet** - Quick reference of essential keybindings organized by category
- **Backup Keybindings** - Save your current keybindings to a timestamped file
- **Open Config File** - Direct access to the Sway config for advanced editing

The keybinding manager uses Wofi for all interactions, maintaining the keyboard-first workflow while making customization accessible to everyone. All custom keybindings are added to a dedicated section at the end of the config file, keeping your customizations organized and separate from the defaults.

### Manual Customization

You can also edit keybindings directly in the config. There's a dedicated customization section at the end of the keybindings area:

```
# Examples:
bindsym $mod+Shift+d exec Discord
bindsym $mod+s exec spotify
bindsym $mod+d exec steam
```

**Configuring Default Applications:**

Edit the variables section at the top of `sway/config`:
```bash
set $editor cursor        # Change to: code, micro, vim, etc.
set $filemanager nautilus   # Modern GNOME file manager
set $term foot            # Change to: alacritty, kitty, etc.
```

## Screenshot System

This configuration features an interactive screenshot system designed to replicate the intuitive GNOME/COSMIC screenshot experience on Sway.

### Design Philosophy

The screenshot workflow prioritizes user choice, clarity, and speed. Rather than immediately saving or copying screenshots, the system presents users with a visual selector followed by a prominent keyboard-driven dialog. Simply press C or S - no Enter key required, no mouse needed. The dialog is impossible to miss and optimized for rapid keyboard workflow.

### Technical Stack

The screenshot system is built using lightweight Wayland-native tools:

- **grim** - Screenshot utility for Wayland compositors (captures pixels)
- **slurp** - Region selection tool for Wayland (provides the visual area picker)
- **wl-clipboard** - Command-line clipboard utilities for Wayland (handles copy operations)
- **grimshot** - Helper script that orchestrates grim, slurp, and wl-copy (used for power shortcuts)
- **foot** - Terminal emulator used to display the keyboard-driven dialog
- **mako** - Notification daemon that confirms screenshot actions

### Workflow

**Primary workflow (Print Screen):**
1. Press Print Screen
2. Visual crosshair selector appears (slurp)
3. Click and drag to select the screenshot area
4. Dialog window appears in center of screen displaying:
   - "Press [C] to Copy to Clipboard"
   - "Press [S] to Save to Pictures"
5. Press **C** or **S** (no Enter required)
6. Dialog closes and confirmation notification appears

**Power user shortcuts:**
- **Shift+Print** - Instantly capture entire screen and save (no prompts)
- **Ctrl+Print** - Select area and copy to clipboard (skips save option)
- **Ctrl+Shift+Print** - Capture active window and save (no prompts)

### Implementation

The screenshot system uses a custom script in `waybar/scripts/`:

- `screenshot-area.sh` - Interactive workflow with visual area selector and floating terminal dialog

The script launches a centered, floating terminal window that captures a single keypress (C or S) without requiring Enter. The dialog uses the Foot terminal configured to float and center automatically via Sway window rules. All confirmations use mako notifications themed to match the tactical aesthetic.

## Workspace Overview

Get a birds-eye view of all your workspaces and open windows with a single keypress. This feature provides a quick way to see what's running across all workspaces and jump directly to any window or workspace.

### Usage

Press `Super+W` to open the workspace overview.

The overview displays:
- **󰝥 Current workspace** - The workspace you're currently on
- **󰍺 Visible workspaces** - Workspaces visible on other monitors (multi-monitor setups)
- **󰖲 Active workspaces** - Workspaces with open windows
- **Window list** - All open windows under each workspace with their titles
- **󰣐 Window icons** - Each window prefixed with an icon for easy scanning

### Navigation

- **Type to filter** - Start typing to narrow down workspaces or windows
- **Click or Enter** - Select a workspace to switch to it
- **Click window** - Select a window name to focus that specific window
- **Esc** - Close the overview without switching

### When to Use

The workspace overview is most useful when:
- You have multiple workspaces with various applications
- You can't remember which workspace has a specific window
- You want to quickly scan what's open without cycling through workspaces
- You need to jump to a specific window across workspaces

This is **much faster** than manually cycling through workspaces (`PgUp/PgDn` or `Super+1-9`) when you're looking for something specific.

### Implementation

The overview is implemented as a custom script (`workspace-windows.sh`) that:
1. Queries Sway's IPC for all workspaces and their windows
2. Formats the data with icons and clear labeling
3. Displays in Wofi with tactical theme styling
4. Handles workspace switching and window focusing

## Night Mode

This configuration includes a GNOME-style night mode toggle accessible directly from the Waybar.

### Overview

Night mode reduces blue light emission by adjusting the color temperature of your display, making it easier on the eyes during evening/night use. The feature is implemented using `wlsunset`, the Wayland equivalent of redshift.

### Usage

Toggle night mode using either method:
- **Click** the moon icon (󰖔) in the Waybar
- **Press** `Mod+N` keyboard shortcut

When toggled:
- **Active**: Icon displays in amber/orange color, screen has warm color temperature
- **Inactive**: Icon displays in muted olive color, screen has normal color temperature
- Hover for tooltip showing current state
- Notification confirms each state change

### Configuration

The night mode uses the following color temperature settings:
- **Day temperature**: 4500K (slightly warm)
- **Night temperature**: 3400K (warm, reduces blue light)

These values can be adjusted in `waybar/scripts/night-mode-toggle.sh` by modifying the `-T` (day) and `-t` (night) parameters for `wlsunset`.

### Implementation

Two custom scripts work together:
- `night-mode-toggle.sh` - Starts/stops wlsunset and updates state
- `night-mode-status.sh` - Reports current state to Waybar (icon and tooltip)

The state persists across Waybar restarts using a cache file at `~/.cache/night-mode-state`.

## On-Screen Display (OSD)

This configuration includes SwayOSD for elegant visual feedback when adjusting volume and brightness levels.

### Overview

SwayOSD provides centered, beautiful overlays that appear when volume or brightness is changed. This replicates the native OSD experience found in GNOME, KDE, and other desktop environments, providing visual confirmation of the current level.

### Features

- **Centered display** - OSD appears in the middle of the screen for maximum visibility
- **Tactical styling** - Matches the tactical color palette with khaki/tan accents
- **Auto-dismiss** - Fades after 2 seconds of inactivity
- **Smooth animations** - Clean transitions and progress bar updates
- **Automatic icons** - Shows appropriate icons for volume (speaker/mute) and brightness
- **Progress bars** - Visual representation of current level (0-100%)

### Usage

SwayOSD activates automatically when using volume or brightness controls:

**Volume controls:**
- **Volume Up** - XF86AudioRaiseVolume (usually Fn+F3 on ThinkPad)
- **Volume Down** - XF86AudioLowerVolume (usually Fn+F2 on ThinkPad)
- **Mute** - XF86AudioMute (usually Fn+F1 on ThinkPad)
- **Mic Mute** - XF86AudioMicMute (usually Fn+F4 on ThinkPad)

**Brightness controls:**
- **Brightness Up** - XF86MonBrightnessUp (usually Fn+F6 on ThinkPad)
- **Brightness Down** - XF86MonBrightnessDown (usually Fn+F5 on ThinkPad)

### Styling

The OSD appearance is configured in `swayosd/style.css` with:
- **Background**: Charcoal (`#1C1C1C`) with transparency
- **Border**: Tactical tan (`#C3B091`) with 4px width and 12px rounded corners
- **Progress bar**: Tactical tan fill on tactical gray (`#2B2D2E`) background with 24px height
- **Text**: Tactical tan (`#C3B091`) in monospace font
- **Icons**: Tactical tan colored icons
- **Position**: Perfectly centered on screen (top-margin: 0.5)

### Implementation

SwayOSD consists of two components:
- **swayosd-server** - Background daemon that displays the OSD (auto-started by Sway)
- **swayosd-client** - Command-line tool that triggers OSD displays

All volume and brightness keybindings in the Sway config use `swayosd-client` instead of direct `pactl` or `brightnessctl` commands, ensuring every adjustment shows visual feedback.

## Login Screen (SDDM)

This configuration includes a custom SDDM theme that matches the tactical aesthetic. The login screen features a minimal, centered design with the same color palette as the rest of the setup.

### Features

- **Tactical color scheme** - Uses the same khaki/tan, olive, and charcoal palette
- **Minimal design** - Centered login box with clean fields for username and password
- **Session selector** - Choose between available desktop sessions (Sway, X11, etc.)
- **Power controls** - Shutdown, reboot, and suspend buttons
- **Date and time display** - Shows current date/time in the bottom left
- **Monospace typography** - Consistent with terminal and Waybar styling
- **Smooth animations** - Subtle hover effects and focus indicators

### Installation

The SDDM theme files are located in `sddm/tactical/` and need to be installed to the system:

```bash
cd /home/ryan/Projects/bunkeros/sddm
./install-theme.sh
```

This script will:
1. Copy the theme to `/usr/share/sddm/themes/tactical`
2. Configure SDDM to use the tactical theme in `/etc/sddm.conf`

To enable SDDM as your display manager:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable sddm.service
```

To test the theme without logging out:

```bash
sddm-greeter --test-mode --theme /usr/share/sddm/themes/tactical
```

### Theme Files

- `Main.qml` - Main theme interface (QML markup)
- `theme.conf` - Theme configuration
- `metadata.desktop` - Theme metadata
- `install-theme.sh` - Installation script

The theme uses Qt Quick/QML for rendering and follows SDDM's theme API 2.0. All UI elements are styled to match the tactical aesthetic with proper focus indicators and hover states.

## GTK Theme (Dark Mode & Application Styling)

This configuration includes custom GTK 3.0 and GTK 4.0 themes that apply the tactical color scheme to all GTK applications, system dialogs, and most desktop applications.

### Features

- **Dark mode by default** - All GTK apps use dark theme
- **Tactical color palette** - Matches the rest of the setup (khaki/tan, olive, charcoal)
- **Custom styling** - Overrides for buttons, inputs, sidebars, headers, menus
- **Consistent experience** - All applications blend seamlessly with the theme
- **Focus indicators** - Clear visual feedback using tactical tan (#C3B091)
- **Smooth transitions** - Subtle hover and active states

### Installation

The GTK theme files are in `gtk-3.0/` and `gtk-4.0/` directories. Install them:

```bash
cd /home/ryan/Projects/bunkeros/gtk-3.0
./install.sh

cd /home/ryan/Projects/bunkeros/gtk-4.0
./install.sh
```

This will:
1. Create backups of existing GTK configs (if any)
2. Symlink the tactical theme files to `~/.config/gtk-3.0/` and `~/.config/gtk-4.0/`

### What Gets Styled

- **File Manager (Nautilus)** - File browser, thumbnails, search, and network locations
- **System Dialogs** - File pickers, color pickers, print dialogs
- **Applications** - Any GTK-based app (GIMP, Inkscape, etc.)
- **UI Elements** - Buttons, inputs, menus, scrollbars, tooltips, tabs

### Files

**GTK 3.0:**

- `gtk.css` - Custom CSS with tactical color overrides

**GTK 4.0:**
- `settings.ini` - Enables dark theme for newer apps
- `gtk.css` - Custom CSS for GTK 4 applications

### Applying Changes

After installation, restart any running GTK applications:

```bash
pkill nautilus
nautilus &
```

Or simply log out and back in for system-wide changes.

### Customization

To adjust colors, edit `gtk-3.0/gtk.css` or `gtk-4.0/gtk.css`. The main colors used:

- **Background**: `#1C1C1C` (Charcoal)
- **Surface**: `#2B2D2E` (Tactical Gray)
- **Primary**: `#C3B091` (Tactical Tan)
- **Secondary**: `#6B7A54` (Olive)
- **Tertiary**: `#3C4A2F` (Muted Olive)
- **Text**: `#D4D4D4` (Off-White)

After making changes, the updates apply immediately to newly opened applications (existing apps need restart).

## Quick Actions Menu

### Technical Details

Each web app:
- Creates a `.desktop` file in `~/.local/share/applications/`
- Uses browser's app mode (`--app` flag for Chromium-based, `--new-window` for Firefox)
- Uses your main browser's profile for seamless login sharing
- Downloads/stores icon in `~/.local/share/sway-webapp/icons/`

**Login Behavior:**
- Already signed in if you're logged into your main browser
- All web apps share the same login sessions as your main browser
- No need to re-authenticate - instant access to your accounts!

For detailed documentation, see [`webapp/README.md`](webapp/README.md).

**Supported platforms:**
- Google Meet, Zoom, Microsoft Teams (web and native)
- Discord, Slack, Jitsi Meet
- Any WebRTC-based conferencing tool

**See the complete guide:** [`VIDEOCONFERENCING.md`](VIDEOCONFERENCING.md)

### User-Configurable Applications

You'll also need to install your preferred applications for the keybindings:

**Web Browser** (Super+b):
```bash
sudo pacman -S chromium  # or: firefox, brave-bin (AUR)
```
Set your default browser: `xdg-settings set default-web-browser chromium.desktop`

**Text Editor** (Super+e):
```bash
# Choose one based on your preference:
sudo pacman -S code           # VS Code
# or cursor from AUR
# or: micro, vim, neovim, etc.
```
Update the variable in `sway/config`: `set $editor cursor`

**Calculator** (Super+c):
```bash
sudo pacman -S mate-calc
```
MATE Calculator is a simple, GTK3-based calculator that integrates perfectly with the tactical theme. It provides essential calculation features without the complexity of scientific calculators, and fully supports custom CSS theming.

### Login Manager (Optional)

For a themed login screen that matches the tactical aesthetic:

```bash
sudo pacman -S sddm qt6-svg qt6-declarative
```

After installing, run the installation script:
```bash
cd /home/ryan/Projects/bunkeros/sddm
./install-theme.sh
```

Then enable SDDM:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable sddm.service
```

See the [Login Screen (SDDM)](#login-screen-sddm) section for details.

### Fonts

This configuration requires a **Nerd Font** to display icons properly in Waybar. Nerd Fonts are patched fonts that include thousands of glyphs (icons) from popular icon collections like Font Awesome and Material Design Icons.

**Install MesloLGL Nerd Font (recommended):**
```bash
sudo pacman -S ttf-meslo-nerd
```

**Alternative - Install all Nerd Font symbols:**
```bash
sudo pacman -S ttf-nerd-fonts-symbols ttf-nerd-fonts-symbols-mono
```

After installing the font, restart Waybar to see the icons:
```bash
pkill waybar && waybar &
```

The configuration uses MesloLGL Nerd Font by default. This can be changed in `waybar/style.css` to use a different Nerd Font if desired.

## Installation

BunkerOS provides a robust, automated installation system with compatibility checking and error recovery.

### Quick Start

```bash
cd ~/Projects
git clone https://github.com/forge-55/bunkeros.git
cd bunkeros

# Check system compatibility (recommended)
./scripts/check-compatibility.sh

# Install BunkerOS with robust error handling
./install-robust.sh
```

### Alternative: Manual Setup

If you prefer the original setup process:

```bash
# Install dependencies manually first
sudo pacman -S sway autotiling-rs waybar wofi mako foot nautilus \
               sushi eog evince lite-xl btop grim slurp wl-clipboard \
               brightnessctl playerctl pavucontrol network-manager-applet \

**Benefits of this structure:**
- All configs version-controlled in one place
- Easy to backup and restore
- Changes to project files immediately reflect in system
- Simple to share and replicate across machines
- Theme system allows instant visual changes without losing customizations

## Customization

### Wallpaper

Edit `sway/config` line 34 to set a custom wallpaper:

```
exec_always "killall swaybg 2>/dev/null; swaybg -i ~/Pictures/wallpaper.jpg -m fill"
```

### Gaps and Borders

Adjust window spacing in `sway/config`:

```
gaps inner 8    # Space between windows
gaps outer 8    # Space around edges
default_border pixel 3    # Border thickness
```

### Visual Effects

The design embraces a flat, minimal aesthetic with restrained use of visual effects. All styling is pure CSS with zero performance overhead.

**Waybar enhancements:**
- Numbered workspace indicators with refined box styling (ArchCraft-inspired)
- 7 persistent workspaces with tactical spacing
- Minimal borders with rounded corners
- Active workspace: khaki border and text, enhanced padding
- Inactive workspace: subtle olive border with muted text
- Hover workspace: semi-transparent background
- Icon-based status modules with dynamic states
- Night mode toggle with color temperature adjustment (GNOME-style)
- Power menu, network manager, and battery info on click
- Clean spacing and uniform icon distribution

**Wofi enhancements:**
- Minimal border treatment for clean appearance
- Subtle left accent bar on selections
- Flat input field styling
- Focus on content over decoration

**Terminal styling:**
- Two-line prompt with tactical separators
- Current directory in khaki with git branch integration
- Status indicator (olive for success, amber for errors)
- Tactical color palette throughout
- Beam cursor with blink
- Custom color scheme for man pages and less
- Font size optimized for 1920x1080 displays
- Custom directory colors for better visibility

**btop system monitor:**
- Custom tactical theme with color gradients
- Khaki highlights and olive accents
- Charcoal background matching overall aesthetic
- Gradient meters transitioning from olive to khaki to amber
- Minimal borders and clean presentation

### Colors

All color values are clearly labeled in each config file. The Sway window colors are in `sway/config` starting at line 47.

## Workspaces

The configuration features 7 persistent numbered workspaces with subtle, non-distracting design:

**Visual states:**
- **Inactive**: Minimal styling with muted olive text
- **Active**: Bold khaki text with subtle olive background and defined border
- **Hover**: Light olive tint with khaki text
- **Urgent**: Amber background with pulsing animation

Numbered workspaces provide clear identification while staying unobtrusive during focused work. The design works naturally with Waybar's capabilities and fits the tactical aesthetic. Workspaces are flexible and not assigned to specific applications.

## Key Bindings

Uses standard Sway bindings with Mod4 (Super/Windows key):

- **Mod+Return** - Open terminal
- **Mod+d** - Launch Wofi
- **Mod+Shift+q** - Close window
- **Mod+h/j/k/l** - Navigate windows (vim keys)
- **Mod+1-7** - Switch workspaces
- **Mod+Shift+1-7** - Move window to workspace
- **Mod+r** - Resize mode

**Screenshots:**
- **Print** - Interactive area selector, then choose Copy or Save
- **Shift+Print** - Quick capture full screen and save
- **Ctrl+Print** - Quick capture area and copy to clipboard
- **Ctrl+Shift+Print** - Quick capture active window and save

See the [Screenshot System](#screenshot-system) section above for detailed workflow and technical implementation.

**Utilities:**
- **Mod+N** - Toggle night mode (color temperature adjustment)
- **Page Up** - Switch to previous workspace
- **Page Down** - Switch to next workspace

**Additional Keybindings:**

See `sway/config` for complete keybinding reference.

## Performance Notes

This configuration is optimized for lightweight performance on older hardware. All visual enhancements use CSS-based effects rather than compositor-level features, resulting in:

- Minimal RAM usage (~50-80MB for Sway)
- No GPU-intensive blur or animation effects
- Zero CPU overhead from visual styling
- Tested and optimized for ThinkPad T480 (Intel UHD 620)
