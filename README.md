- **Zero performance overhead** - pure CSS styling

## Color Palette

The configuration uses a carefully crafted tactical palette that balances functionality with aesthetics:

- **Primary (Khaki/Tan)** `#C3B091` - Focus indicators, highlights, active workspace markers
- **Secondary (Olive)** `#4A5240` - Accents, borders, workspace hover states
- **Tertiary (Muted Olive)** `#3C4A2F` - Subtle borders and secondary accents
- **Background (Charcoal)** `#1C1C1C` - Primary dark background
- **Surface (Tactical Gray)** `#2B2D2E` - Window backgrounds, input fields
- **Alert (Amber)** `#CC7832` - Warnings, critical states, mode indicators
- **Text (Off-White)** `#D4D4D4` - Primary text color

### Design Philosophy

The palette prioritizes readability and focus while maintaining a cohesive tactical aesthetic. The design follows a flat, understated approach with minimal shadows and clean borders - emphasizing function over decoration, perfect for performance-conscious setups like the ThinkPad T480.

## Screenshot System

This configuration features an interactive screenshot system designed to replicate the intuitive GNOME/COSMIC screenshot experience on Sway.

### Design Philosophy

The screenshot workflow prioritizes user choice, clarity, and speed. Rather than immediately saving or copying screenshots, the system presents users with a visual selector followed by a prominent keyboard-driven dialog. Simply press C or S - no Enter key required, no mouse needed. The dialog is impossible to miss and optimized for rapid keyboard workflow.

### Technical Stack

The screenshot system is built using lightweight Wayland-native tools:

- **grim** - Screenshot utility for Wayland compositors (captures pixels)
- **slurp** - Region selection tool for Wayland (provides the visual area picker)
- **wl-clipboard** - Command-line clipboard utilities for Wayland (handles copy operations)
- **grimshot** - Helper script that orchestrates grim, slurp, and wl-copy (used for power shortcuts)
- **foot** - Terminal emulator used to display the keyboard-driven dialog
- **mako** - Notification daemon that confirms screenshot actions

### Workflow

**Primary workflow (Print Screen):**
1. Press Print Screen
2. Visual crosshair selector appears (slurp)
3. Click and drag to select the screenshot area
4. Dialog window appears in center of screen displaying:
   - "Press [C] to Copy to Clipboard"
   - "Press [S] to Save to Pictures"
5. Press **C** or **S** (no Enter required)
6. Dialog closes and confirmation notification appears

**Power user shortcuts:**
- **Shift+Print** - Instantly capture entire screen and save (no prompts)
- **Ctrl+Print** - Select area and copy to clipboard (skips save option)
- **Ctrl+Shift+Print** - Capture active window and save (no prompts)

### Implementation

The screenshot system uses a custom script in `waybar/scripts/`:

- `screenshot-area.sh` - Interactive workflow with visual area selector and floating terminal dialog

The script launches a centered, floating terminal window that captures a single keypress (C or S) without requiring Enter. The dialog uses the Foot terminal configured to float and center automatically via Sway window rules. All confirmations use mako notifications themed to match the tactical aesthetic.

## Night Mode

This configuration includes a GNOME-style night mode toggle accessible directly from the Waybar.

### Overview

Night mode reduces blue light emission by adjusting the color temperature of your display, making it easier on the eyes during evening/night use. The feature is implemented using `wlsunset`, the Wayland equivalent of redshift.

### Usage

Toggle night mode using either method:
- **Click** the moon icon (ó°–”) in the Waybar
- **Press** `Mod+N` keyboard shortcut

When toggled:
- **Active**: Icon displays in amber/orange color, screen has warm color temperature
- **Inactive**: Icon displays in muted olive color, screen has normal color temperature
- Hover for tooltip showing current state
- Notification confirms each state change

### Configuration

The night mode uses the following color temperature settings:
- **Day temperature**: 4500K (slightly warm)
- **Night temperature**: 3400K (warm, reduces blue light)

These values can be adjusted in `waybar/scripts/night-mode-toggle.sh` by modifying the `-T` (day) and `-t` (night) parameters for `wlsunset`.

### Implementation

Two custom scripts work together:
- `night-mode-toggle.sh` - Starts/stops wlsunset and updates state
- `night-mode-status.sh` - Reports current state to Waybar (icon and tooltip)

The state persists across Waybar restarts using a cache file at `~/.cache/night-mode-state`.

## On-Screen Display (OSD)

This configuration includes SwayOSD for elegant visual feedback when adjusting volume and brightness levels.

### Overview

SwayOSD provides centered, beautiful overlays that appear when volume or brightness is changed. This replicates the native OSD experience found in GNOME, KDE, and other desktop environments, providing visual confirmation of the current level.

### Features

- **Centered display** - OSD appears in the middle of the screen for maximum visibility
- **Tactical styling** - Matches the tactical color palette with khaki/tan accents
- **Auto-dismiss** - Fades after 2 seconds of inactivity
- **Smooth animations** - Clean transitions and progress bar updates
- **Automatic icons** - Shows appropriate icons for volume (speaker/mute) and brightness
- **Progress bars** - Visual representation of current level (0-100%)

### Usage

SwayOSD activates automatically when using volume or brightness controls:

**Volume controls:**
- **Volume Up** - XF86AudioRaiseVolume (usually Fn+F3 on ThinkPad)
- **Volume Down** - XF86AudioLowerVolume (usually Fn+F2 on ThinkPad)
- **Mute** - XF86AudioMute (usually Fn+F1 on ThinkPad)
- **Mic Mute** - XF86AudioMicMute (usually Fn+F4 on ThinkPad)

**Brightness controls:**
- **Brightness Up** - XF86MonBrightnessUp (usually Fn+F6 on ThinkPad)
- **Brightness Down** - XF86MonBrightnessDown (usually Fn+F5 on ThinkPad)

### Styling

The OSD appearance is configured in `swayosd/style.css` with:
- **Background**: Charcoal (`#1C1C1C`) with transparency
- **Border**: Tactical tan (`#C3B091`) with 4px width and 12px rounded corners
- **Progress bar**: Tactical tan fill on tactical gray (`#2B2D2E`) background with 24px height
- **Text**: Tactical tan (`#C3B091`) in monospace font
- **Icons**: Tactical tan colored icons
- **Position**: Perfectly centered on screen (top-margin: 0.5)

### Implementation

SwayOSD consists of two components:
- **swayosd-server** - Background daemon that displays the OSD (auto-started by Sway)
- **swayosd-client** - Command-line tool that triggers OSD displays

All volume and brightness keybindings in the Sway config use `swayosd-client` instead of direct `pactl` or `brightnessctl` commands, ensuring every adjustment shows visual feedback.

## Requirements

```bash
sudo pacman -S sway waybar wofi foot swaybg brightnessctl sway-contrib grim slurp wl-clipboard mako wlsunset swayosd
```

- `sway-contrib` includes grimshot for screenshots
- `grim` and `slurp` are the underlying screenshot tools
- `wl-clipboard` enables copying screenshots to clipboard
- `foot` is the terminal emulator used for the screenshot dialog and general use
- `mako` is the notification daemon for screenshot confirmations and other alerts
- `wlsunset` provides color temperature adjustment for night mode
- `swayosd` provides on-screen display overlays for volume and brightness

### Fonts

This configuration requires a **Nerd Font** to display icons properly in Waybar. Nerd Fonts are patched fonts that include thousands of glyphs (icons) from popular icon collections like Font Awesome and Material Design Icons.

**Install MesloLGL Nerd Font (recommended):**
```bash
sudo pacman -S ttf-meslo-nerd
```

**Alternative - Install all Nerd Font symbols:**
```bash
sudo pacman -S ttf-nerd-fonts-symbols ttf-nerd-fonts-symbols-mono
```

After installing the font, restart Waybar to see the icons:
```bash
pkill waybar && waybar &
```

The configuration uses MesloLGL Nerd Font by default. This can be changed in `waybar/style.css` to use a different Nerd Font if desired.

## Customization

### Wallpaper

Edit `sway/config` line 34 to set a custom wallpaper:

```
exec_always "killall swaybg 2>/dev/null; swaybg -i ~/Pictures/wallpaper.jpg -m fill"
```

### Gaps and Borders

Adjust window spacing in `sway/config`:

```
gaps inner 8    # Space between windows
gaps outer 8    # Space around edges
default_border pixel 3    # Border thickness
```

### Colors

All color values are clearly labeled in each config file. The Sway window colors are in `sway/config` starting at line 47.

## Workspaces

The configuration features 7 persistent numbered workspaces with subtle, non-distracting design:

**Visual states:**
- **Inactive**: Minimal styling with muted olive text
- **Active**: Bold khaki text with subtle olive background and defined border
- **Hover**: Light olive tint with khaki text
- **Urgent**: Amber background with pulsing animation

Numbered workspaces provide clear identification while staying unobtrusive during focused work. The design works naturally with Waybar's capabilities and fits the tactical aesthetic. Workspaces are flexible and not assigned to specific applications.

## Key Bindings

Uses standard Sway bindings with Mod4 (Super/Windows key):

- **Mod+Return** - Open terminal
- **Mod+d** - Launch Wofi
- **Mod+Shift+q** - Close window
- **Mod+h/j/k/l** - Navigate windows (vim keys)
- **Mod+1-7** - Switch workspaces
- **Mod+Shift+1-7** - Move window to workspace
- **Mod+r** - Resize mode

**Screenshots:**
- **Print** - Interactive area selector, then choose Copy or Save
- **Shift+Print** - Quick capture full screen and save
- **Ctrl+Print** - Quick capture area and copy to clipboard
- **Ctrl+Shift+Print** - Quick capture active window and save

See the [Screenshot System](#screenshot-system) section above for detailed workflow and technical implementation.

**Utilities:**

- **Page Up** - Switch to previous workspace
- **Page Down** - Switch to next workspace

**Additional Keybindings:**

See `sway/config` for complete keybinding reference.

## Performance Notes

This configuration is optimized for lightweight performance on older hardware. All visual enhancements use CSS-based effects rather than compositor-level features, resulting in:

- Minimal RAM usage (~50-80MB for Sway)
- No GPU-intensive blur or animation effects
- Zero CPU overhead from visual styling
- Tested and optimized for ThinkPad T480 (Intel UHD 620)

## Credits

Built with inspiration from popular tiling window manager configurations including Hyprland and COSMIC. Visual polish achieved through smart CSS styling rather than compositor effects.
