PHASE 1 COMPLETE: BunkerOS Portability Implementation
======================================================

Date: October 21, 2025
Status: ✓ SUCCESSFUL - All changes applied and tested

OBJECTIVE
---------
Remove hardcoded paths to make BunkerOS installable on any machine
with any username, while maintaining full functionality on the
development machine.

CHANGES MADE
------------

1. setup.sh (Main installer)
   - Changed: PROJECT_DIR="/home/ryan/Projects/bunkeros"
   - To: PROJECT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"
   - Impact: Now works from any directory, any username

2. scripts/theme-switcher.sh (Theme management)
   - Changed: PROJECT_DIR="/home/ryan/Projects/bunkeros"
   - To: PROJECT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/.." && pwd)"
   - Impact: Theme switcher finds themes directory dynamically

3. gtk-3.0/install.sh (GTK3 theme installer)
   - Added: PROJECT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/.." && pwd)"
   - Changed: Hardcoded symlink paths to use $PROJECT_DIR
   - Impact: GTK3 themes install from any location

4. gtk-4.0/install.sh (GTK4 theme installer)
   - Added: PROJECT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/.." && pwd)"
   - Changed: Hardcoded symlink paths to use $PROJECT_DIR
   - Impact: GTK4 themes install from any location

5. sddm/install-theme.sh (SDDM theme installer)
   - Added: PROJECT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/.." && pwd)"
   - Changed: SOURCE_DIR and SESSION_SOURCE to use $PROJECT_DIR
   - Impact: SDDM theme installs from any location

6. waybar/scripts/quick-menu.sh (Quick actions menu)
   - Added: PROJECT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/../.." && pwd)"
   - Changed: Theme switcher call to use $PROJECT_DIR
   - Impact: Quick menu finds theme switcher dynamically

7. waybar/scripts/theme-menu.sh (Theme options menu)
   - Added: PROJECT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/../.." && pwd)"
   - Changed: Theme switcher call to use $PROJECT_DIR
   - Impact: Theme menu finds theme switcher dynamically

8. waybar/scripts/appearance-menu.sh (Appearance menu)
   - Added: PROJECT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/../.." && pwd)"
   - Changed: Theme switcher call to use $PROJECT_DIR
   - Impact: Appearance menu finds theme switcher dynamically

9. waybar/scripts/webapp-menu.sh (Web app manager menu)
   - Added: PROJECT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/../.." && pwd)"
   - Changed: WEBAPP_BIN to use $PROJECT_DIR
   - Impact: Webapp menu finds webapp tools dynamically

VERIFICATION RESULTS
--------------------

✓ No hardcoded paths remaining (grep search returned empty)
✓ All scripts pass bash syntax validation
✓ All existing symlinks intact and functional
✓ PROJECT_DIR correctly detected in all scripts
✓ Theme directory successfully located
✓ GTK settings files successfully located
✓ Development system still fully functional

TESTING PERFORMED
-----------------

1. Syntax validation of all 9 modified scripts: PASSED
2. Hardcoded path search across all scripts: NONE FOUND
3. Symlink integrity check: ALL INTACT
4. PROJECT_DIR detection in theme-switcher: WORKING
5. PROJECT_DIR detection in GTK installers: WORKING

WHAT THIS ENABLES
-----------------

Users can now install BunkerOS with:
  git clone https://github.com/forge-55/bunkeros.git ~/Projects/bunkeros
  cd ~/Projects/bunkeros
  ./setup.sh

And it will work regardless of:
  - Username (not just "ryan")
  - Installation directory (not just ~/Projects/bunkeros)
  - Home directory location

DEVELOPER WORKFLOW
------------------

✓ Nothing changed for active development
✓ Symlinks still enable live config editing
✓ Changes still push to GitHub normally
✓ System still works exactly as before

BACKUP CREATED
--------------

A backup was created before changes:
  ~/bunkeros-backup-20251021-*.tar.gz

Contains:
  - ~/.config/sway
  - ~/.config/waybar
  - ~/.config/wofi
  - ~/.config/mako
  - ~/.config/foot
  - ~/.config/btop
  - ~/.config/gtk-3.0
  - ~/.config/gtk-4.0
  - ~/.config/themes
  - ~/.bashrc

NEXT STEPS
----------

Phase 2: Create master installer and modular install scripts
  - install.sh (master orchestrator)
  - scripts/install-dependencies.sh
  - scripts/install-system-services.sh
  - scripts/install-user-environment.sh

See IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md for details.

PATTERN USED
------------

All scripts now use dynamic path detection:

  # For scripts in project root:
  PROJECT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"

  # For scripts one level deep (scripts/):
  PROJECT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/.." && pwd)"

  # For scripts two levels deep (waybar/scripts/):
  PROJECT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/../.." && pwd)"

This ensures PROJECT_DIR always points to the repo root, regardless
of where the repo is located or what username is running the script.
