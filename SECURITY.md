# BunkerOS Security

**Professional-grade protection for distraction-free productivity.**

---

## Security Philosophy

BunkerOS implements professional-grade security to protect your work environment and maintain system integrity, without the operational overhead of security-focused distributions. Our security approach treats protection as a productivity enabler—firewall defenses, system hardening, and application containment work silently in the background, letting you focus on mission-critical work rather than security administration.

**Secure by default, productive by design.** Sensible defaults provide strong protection out-of-box, while optional enhancements give you control over encryption and advanced features when needed. Security in BunkerOS isn't about paranoia or complexity—it's about protecting your focus environment so you can work without distraction or compromise.

We believe security serves productivity, not the other way around. Enterprise-level protection should work invisibly, maintain system integrity automatically, and rarely require your attention.

## Automatic Security Features

BunkerOS enables robust security measures by default. These features work silently in the background, protecting your workflow integrity without operational burden:

### Firewall Protection (UFW)
- **Default deny incoming, allow outgoing** policy
- Protects network exposure while permitting normal internet usage
- Pre-configured for common development workflows
- Invisible operation—no manual rule management required

### Package Signature Verification
- Inherited from Arch Linux and CachyOS foundation
- Every package cryptographically verified before installation
- Protects against supply chain attacks and compromised packages
- Automatic validation with zero user intervention

### Application Containment (AppArmor)
- Basic confinement profiles for system-critical applications
- Limits application access to filesystem and resources
- Reduces impact of potential application vulnerabilities
- Operates transparently without affecting application functionality

### Hardened Kernel Parameters
- Security-focused kernel configuration from CachyOS foundation
- ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization) enabled
- Stack protection and memory hardening
- Performance-optimized while maintaining strong security posture

### Login Auditing
- Failed authentication attempt logging
- Helps detect unauthorized access attempts
- Lightweight monitoring without privacy invasion
- Records security-relevant events for system integrity

## Optional Security Enhancements

During installation or post-setup, you can enable additional security features based on your needs:

### Home Directory Encryption
**What it does**: Encrypts your personal files and data at rest.

**Trade-off**: Minimal performance impact on modern hardware; requires password at login (no auto-login).

**Recommended for**: 
- Laptops and portable systems
- Shared workstations
- Systems containing sensitive work

**Not essential for**: 
- Desktop systems in controlled environments
- Single-user home systems with physical security

### Secure Boot Configuration
**What it does**: Prevents unauthorized bootloader and kernel modifications.

**Trade-off**: Requires additional setup during installation; limits kernel flexibility.

**Recommended for**: 
- Dual-boot systems
- Security-conscious workflows
- Compliance requirements

**Not essential for**: 
- Single-boot dedicated workstations
- Development systems requiring kernel modifications

### Automatic Security Updates
**What it does**: Automatically applies security patches from upstream.

**Trade-off**: Potential for rare update conflicts; reduces manual update control.

**Recommended for**: 
- Production workstations
- Users who value convenience
- Systems requiring minimal maintenance

**Not essential for**: 
- Development environments requiring update control
- Users who actively manage system updates

## Advanced Security Configuration

For power users and specialized security requirements, BunkerOS supports advanced configurations:

### Custom AppArmor Profiles
Extend application containment beyond default profiles:
- Create custom profiles for third-party applications
- Fine-tune resource access for specific workflows
- Balance security granularity with operational needs

**Documentation**: See AppArmor official documentation for profile syntax and testing.

### SSH Hardening
Secure remote access for development and administration:
- Key-based authentication (disable password auth)
- Custom port configuration
- Fail2ban integration for brute-force protection
- Rate limiting and connection controls

**Recommendation**: Only enable SSH when remote access is required; disable when unnecessary.

### Full-Disk Encryption (FDE)
Encrypt entire system beyond home directory:
- LUKS encryption during installation
- Protects all data including system files
- Requires passphrase before system boot

**Trade-off**: Cannot use auto-unlock features; all boots require passphrase entry.

### VPN Integration
Route traffic through VPN for privacy and security:
- WireGuard support for performance
- OpenVPN compatibility for flexibility
- NetworkManager integration for convenience

**Use cases**: Remote work, privacy-sensitive workflows, geo-restricted access.

## Security and the CachyOS Foundation

BunkerOS's security model builds on the trusted Arch Linux and CachyOS foundation:

### Layered Trust Model
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│   BunkerOS Security Layer           │
│   • UFW firewall defaults           │
│   • AppArmor profiles               │
│   • Workflow-specific hardening     │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│   CachyOS Performance Layer         │
│   • Hardened kernel parameters      │
│   • Optimized security features     │
│   • Package signature verification  │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│   Arch Linux Foundation             │
│   • Rolling security updates        │
│   • Trusted package maintainers     │
│   • Community security auditing     │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Security Update Process
1. **Upstream patches**: Linux kernel and package maintainers release security fixes
2. **Arch integration**: Arch Linux packages and tests security updates
3. **CachyOS optimization**: CachyOS rebuilds with performance optimizations intact
4. **BunkerOS deployment**: Updates delivered through standard `pacman` workflow

**User action required**: Run `sudo pacman -Syu` regularly (weekly recommended) or enable automatic security updates.

### Package Verification Chain
- **GPG signature validation**: Every package cryptographically signed by maintainers
- **Database integrity**: Package database checksums verified on each sync
- **Transport security**: HTTPS-only package downloads from official mirrors
- **Trust inheritance**: BunkerOS trusts Arch → CachyOS → upstream security practices

This transparent chain ensures you receive legitimate, unmodified packages from trusted sources.

## Security Best Practices

Beyond built-in features, follow these practices to maintain workflow integrity:

### Regular System Updates
```bash
# Weekly security and package updates
sudo pacman -Syu
```

Keep your system current with latest security patches. BunkerOS's rolling-release model means security fixes arrive continuously, not on fixed schedules.

### Mindful Package Installation
- **Prefer official repositories** over AUR when possible
- **Review AUR PKGBUILDs** before installing community packages
- **Limit installed packages** to reduce attack surface
- **Remove unused software** to minimize maintenance burden

### Strong Authentication
- **Use strong, unique passwords** for user accounts
- **Consider password manager integration** (Bitwarden, KeePassXC)
- **Enable screen lock timeout** for unattended workstations (configured in Sway)

### Backup Workflow Protection
- **Regular backups** protect against data loss (ransomware, hardware failure)
- **Test restore procedures** to verify backup integrity
- **Separate backup storage** from primary system (external drive, cloud)

### Network Awareness
- **Avoid untrusted networks** for sensitive work
- **Use VPN on public Wi-Fi** when accessing work resources
- **Verify HTTPS connections** when handling credentials or sensitive data

## What BunkerOS Security Is NOT

**BunkerOS is not a security-focused distribution.** We provide professional-grade protection for productivity workflows, but we're not designed for high-threat environments.

**Not suitable for**:
- Journalists in hostile regions
- Activists facing state-level threats
- Scenarios requiring anonymity (use Tails/Whonix)
- Air-gapped or classified environments
- Forensic analysis or anti-surveillance workflows

**BunkerOS is suitable for**:
- Professional workstations and development environments
- Privacy-conscious everyday computing
- Small business and freelance work
- Personal productivity and focused computing
- General-purpose secure computing

If your threat model involves nation-state adversaries or requires specialized security features, consider purpose-built security distributions like Qubes OS or Tails.

## Security Philosophy Summary

**Our security approach in three principles:**

1. **Protection serves productivity**: Security features protect your focus environment and workflow integrity, not your identity from surveillance or anonymity from adversaries.

2. **Automatic and invisible**: Strong defaults work silently in the background. You manage work, not security administration.

3. **Enterprise-level without enterprise overhead**: Professional-grade protection without complexity, paranoia, or operational burden.
