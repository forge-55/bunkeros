- `bash` 4.0+

### Bluetooth Commands Used
```bash
bluetoothctl show          # Get adapter status
bluetoothctl devices       # List all devices
bluetoothctl devices Paired # List paired devices
bluetoothctl scan on       # Start scanning
bluetoothctl pair <MAC>    # Pair with device
bluetoothctl trust <MAC>   # Trust device
bluetoothctl connect <MAC> # Connect to device
bluetoothctl disconnect <MAC> # Disconnect from device
bluetoothctl remove <MAC>  # Unpair/remove device
bluetoothctl power on/off  # Enable/disable Bluetooth
```

### Device Type Detection

The script detects device types based on the "Icon" field from `bluetoothctl info`:
- **Audio devices** (headphones, speakers): Û∞ãã
- **Input devices** (keyboards): Û∞åå
- **Mice**: Û∞çΩ
- **Phones**: Û∞Ñú
- **Default**: Û∞ÇØ

### Performance

- **Initial load**: < 1 second with cached results
- **Scan time**: 5-10 seconds for discovering new devices
