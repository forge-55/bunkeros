# Waybar Fix - Installation Complete ‚úÖ

## What Was Fixed

1. **Power Icon** - Corrected the script path
2. **Battery Notification** - Created user-friendly notification script
3. **Network Manager** - Built comprehensive WiFi management interface

## Files Created/Modified

### New Scripts
- `waybar/scripts/battery-info.sh` - Clean battery status notifications
- `waybar/scripts/network-manager.sh` - Full-featured WiFi manager
- `waybar/scripts/NETWORK-MANAGER-README.md` - Documentation

### Modified Files
- `waybar/config` - Updated all three modules (power, battery, network)

### Symlinks Created
- `~/.config/waybar/scripts/battery-info.sh` ‚Üí project script
- `~/.config/waybar/scripts/network-manager.sh` ‚Üí project script

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Reload Required

The scripts are now in place, but **waybar needs to be reloaded** to use the new configuration.

### To Apply Changes:

**Option 1: Reload Sway (Recommended)**
Press: `Super + Shift + R`

This will reload your entire Sway config including waybar.

**Option 2: Restart Waybar Only**
From within Sway, open a terminal and run:
```bash
killall waybar && waybar -b bar-0 &
```

## Testing After Reload

1. **Power Icon** (Û∞ê•) - Click it, should show shutdown/reboot menu
2. **Battery Icon** - Click it, should show clean notification like "Charging: 85%"
3. **WiFi Icon** (Û∞ñ©) - Click it, should show full network list with signal strength

## Troubleshooting

If clicking the icons still doesn't work after reload:

1. Check if symlinks exist:
```bash
ls -la ~/.config/waybar/scripts/ | grep -E "(network-manager|battery-info|power-menu)"
```

2. Test scripts manually:
```bash
~/.config/waybar/scripts/network-manager.sh
~/.config/waybar/scripts/battery-info.sh
~/.config/waybar/scripts/power-menu.sh
```

3. Check waybar is running:
```bash
pgrep -a waybar
```

4. View waybar logs:
```bash
journalctl --user -u waybar -f
```

- ‚úÖ View all available networks sorted by strength
