# BunkerOS Multi-Monitor Configuration - Workspace Assignments
# This file assigns workspaces to specific monitors
# Auto-generated by scripts/setup-monitors.sh

### Workspace Assignment Strategy
# BunkerOS uses a simple, predictable workspace distribution:
#   - Single monitor: All workspaces (1-10) available on main display
#   - Dual monitor: Workspaces 1-5 on primary, 6-10 on secondary
#   - Triple monitor: Workspaces 1-5 on primary, 6-10 on secondary, 11-15 on tertiary
#
# This prevents workspace confusion and enables muscle memory for multi-monitor setups

### Default Configuration (Single Monitor)
# All workspaces available on any connected monitor
# This works out of the box with no configuration needed

### Dual Monitor Configuration
# Uncomment these lines when you have two monitors configured
# Replace monitor names with your actual outputs from: swaymsg -t get_outputs
#
# Primary monitor workspaces (1-5)
# workspace 1 output $primary
# workspace 2 output $primary
# workspace 3 output $primary
# workspace 4 output $primary
# workspace 5 output $primary
#
# Secondary monitor workspaces (6-10)
# workspace 6 output $secondary
# workspace 7 output $secondary
# workspace 8 output $secondary
# workspace 9 output $secondary
# workspace 10 output $secondary

### Triple Monitor Configuration
# Uncomment for three monitors
#
# Tertiary monitor workspaces (11-15)
# workspace 11 output $tertiary
# workspace 12 output $tertiary
# workspace 13 output $tertiary
# workspace 14 output $tertiary
# workspace 15 output $tertiary

### Workspace Naming (Optional)
# Add semantic names to workspaces for better organization
# Examples:
#   workspace 1 "1:Code"
#   workspace 2 "2:Browser"
#   workspace 3 "3:Terminal"
#   workspace 4 "4:Docs"
#   workspace 5 "5:Chat"
#   workspace 6 "6:Media"
#   workspace 7 "7:Email"
#   workspace 8 "8:Notes"
#   workspace 9 "9:Monitor"
#   workspace 10 "10:Scratch"

### Multi-Monitor Keybindings
# Quick workspace switching for multi-monitor setups
# Jump to first workspace of each monitor

# Focus primary monitor's first workspace
bindsym $mod+Home workspace 1

# Focus secondary monitor's first workspace (if configured)
# bindsym $mod+Mod1+Home workspace 6

# Focus tertiary monitor's first workspace (if configured)
# bindsym $mod+Shift+Mod1+Home workspace 11

### Monitor Focus Shortcuts
# Quickly move focus between monitors
# bindsym $mod+Ctrl+h focus output left
# bindsym $mod+Ctrl+l focus output right
# bindsym $mod+Ctrl+k focus output up
# bindsym $mod+Ctrl+j focus output down

# Move workspace to another monitor
# bindsym $mod+Ctrl+Shift+h move workspace to output left
# bindsym $mod+Ctrl+Shift+l move workspace to output right
# bindsym $mod+Ctrl+Shift+k move workspace to output up
# bindsym $mod+Ctrl+Shift+j move workspace to output down
