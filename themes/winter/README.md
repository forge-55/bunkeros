# Winter Theme

**Arctic Night Inspired**

A dark theme inspired by the Antarctic night sky and polar landscapes, featuring deep polar blues, ice blue accents, and frozen silver metallics for a cool, focused workspace.

## Inspiration

The Winter theme draws inspiration from:
- Deep polar night skies over Antarctica
- Ice blue glaciers and frozen landscapes  
- Cool, crisp winter atmospheres
- The Blancpain Fifty Fathoms Antarctic Ocean watch aesthetics (reimagined for dark mode)

This creates a cool, comfortable dark workspace with icy blue accents, perfect for extended use while maintaining that winter/arctic aesthetic.
