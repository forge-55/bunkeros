# Sahara Theme

**Desert Tactical Operations**

A warm dark theme inspired by Sahara desert operations and Gruvbox aesthetics. Features earthy browns, desert golds, and sandy tones for a rugged, tactical workspace.

## Inspiration

The Sahara theme draws inspiration from:
- Sahara desert tactical operations
- Gruvbox color scheme philosophy
- Blancpain Fifty Fathoms Pacific Ocean (golden/amber tones)
- Sand dunes, desert rock, and earth elements

This creates a warm, comfortable dark workspace with earthy desert tones that reduce eye strain while maintaining that tactical operational aesthetic.
