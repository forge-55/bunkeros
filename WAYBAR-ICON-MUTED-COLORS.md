# Waybar Icon Color Updates - Muted Aesthetic

## Overview
Updated all waybar themes to use more muted, subdued colors for icons while maintaining visual hierarchy and distinction. The Tactical theme serves as the reference for the muted aesthetic.

## Changes Made

### Color Philosophy
- **Before**: Bright, saturated colors (e.g., `#9ECE6A` bright green, `#EBCB8B` bright yellow)
- **After**: Muted, subdued tones (e.g., `#6B8E4E` muted green, `#C0A668` muted yellow)
- **Goal**: Professional, cohesive appearance across all themes

### Tactical Theme (Reference)

Icons use earthy, military-inspired muted tones:
- Network/Battery/Audio: `#4A5240` (muted olive green)
- Memory: `#3C4A2F` (darker olive)

Since waybar style is symlinked to the current theme:

**Reload Sway**: `Super + Shift + R`

Or switch themes to see the new muted aesthetic:
```bash
~/.config/scripts/theme-switcher.sh
```
